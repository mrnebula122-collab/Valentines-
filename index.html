    <h1>To My Forever Valentine</h1>

      <p>
        My love,<br><br>

        This is our first Valentine’s Day together, and I wanted to give you
        something that lasts longer than flowers, longer than words spoken once
        and forgotten. I wanted to give you something that stays — just like my
        love for you.
        <br><br>

        From the moment you entered my life, something in me became calm.
        Loving you feels natural, effortless, like my heart finally recognized
        where it belongs. You are not just the woman I love — you are my wife,
        my choice, my forever.
        <br><br>

        With you, love feels warm and safe. I feel seen, understood, and deeply
        connected. Every version of the future I imagine has you in it —
        laughing with me, growing with me, walking beside me.
        <br><br>

        This is only our first Valentine’s Day, but I promise you this:
        I will choose you in every season, in every version of life,
        again and again.

      <h3>A Poem for You</h3>
      <p>
        If the world were quiet,<br>
        and only one name remained,<br>
        it would be yours —<br>
        written softly in my heart.<br><br>

        You are the reason love feels gentle,<br>
        the reason forever feels possible.<br>
        In a world full of faces,<br>
        you are the only one I see.<br><br>

        I don’t love you loudly for the world —<br>
        I love you deeply, faithfully,<br>
        in the way that stays,<br>
        in the way that chooses.<br><br>

        If love had a shape,<br>
        it would look like you.<br>
        If forever had a name,<br>
        it would be us.
      </p>
